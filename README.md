# Splitrail Cloud

https://splitrail.dev

The cloud for [Splitrail](https://github.com/Piebald-AI/splitrail) - analyzer for agentic AI coding tool usage.  Sync your usage data across devices, and optionally show off your stats on the leaderboard.

Log in with your GitHub account, generate a token and set it with `splitrail config set-token`, then run `splitrail upload` or enable auto-uploading with `splitrail config set auto-upload true` and run `splitrail` directly to see and/or show off your stats.  

Only **anonymized usage data** is uploaded to your Leaderboard account.  **No conversation history** is ever uploaded, and you can delete your account and all your usage data at any time.

For questions or support, please open an issue on GitHub or email us at [support@piebald.ai](mailto:support@piebald.ai).
